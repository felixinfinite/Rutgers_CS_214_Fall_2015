A thread is pretty much like a process 

Threads "run concurrently" 
if on multi-processor: it could run simultaneously.
but on single processor computer : it's just like an illusion ( The same with process )

Threads occupy the same address space - the address space of the creating process
processes occupy different address spaces

- On thread create: new thread of execution in same address space
- On fork: copy of existing process in new address space

2 kinds of thread model:

User thread: let the program handle the threads, the kernel have no idea what the program do
undercover.

Kernel thread: let the kernel handle the threads with thread table

pthread in C is a multithreading library ( short for posix thread ) that is an interface that meets
POSIX standard.

int pthread_create( thread_handle, thread_options/behaviour, subroutine, subroutine_arg);
pthread_join(,...) is like wait of process.

Converstation between thread and process
Thread:
Process: pipe.
