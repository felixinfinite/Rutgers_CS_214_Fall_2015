signal.h library contains the signal handling library. This library is like the idea behind java
try/catch block.

Example :
Java
try{
    // do something
} catch (Exception e){
    // handle somekind of exception
}

C Code causes signal<---------------- go back and try again
---------------------> run signal handler.

sigpromask - examine and change blocked signals.
